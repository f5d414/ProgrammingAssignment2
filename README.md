I don't understand what to do about this assignment. So all I do for this assignment is copying the example codes and changing some variable names and functions.

In my opinion, this assignment is to ask the concept of lexical scoping. So I attached comment about how the lexical scoping is used in my code.

And I am testing my assignment using TestAssign.R file. Test is done by three step.

    1. make sample matrix. I made 10 matrices and put them in a list s. In a list s, I also made space for inverse matrices.

    2. one_shot function is combine makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve in one function. This function computes inverse matrices and caches them.
    
    3. Test the result by matrix product. Matrix product of x and i should be [1 0; 0 1].
